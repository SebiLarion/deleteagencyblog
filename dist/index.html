              I was very proud to take the stage and speak at International Search Summit, BrightonSEO and SearchLeeds, especially because I got the chance to talk about a

            That being said, I also appreciate that Lighthouse is still quite new for a lot of people both in and out of the
            industry, so that’s why I’ve put this blog based on my presentation together to tell you more about it,
            how it works and the approaches you can take to help achieve a 100% performance score with your website.
            </p>

            Equally, this blog will also be a useful recap for any of you who happened to see my talk and may now be looking

            <h3 class="my-4 text-2xl md:text-4xl font-black">What is Lighthouse?</h3>
            <img class="w-full h-full mb-8" src="../img/image-lighthouse.png" alt="Lighthouse">

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4 ">
              Google’s <a class="text-red-500 text-lg hover:underline hover:text-red-700" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">official description</a> is that it is an
              open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages’.
              You can also run Lighthouse against any page that’s public or which requires authentication.
            </p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4 ">
                In terms of its specific functionality, Lighthouse allows you to audit a page’s:
            </p>

            <ul class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-12 leading-loose list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Performance</li>
              <li>Accessibility</li>
              <li>Progressive web apps</li>
              <li>Best practices</li>
              <li>SEO and more</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4 ">
              After Lighthouse has run these audits against your chosen page it will then generate a report for you.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4 "> 
              The official Google description also states that Lighthouse can be run in Chrome DevTools, from a Chrome extension,
              from
              the PageSpeed Insights website, the command line, or as a Node module.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">

              How can a Lighthouse report help you?
            </h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              The report Lighthouse creates will provide you with recommendations and opportunities for optimisation and will give
              you
              examples of areas where you could look to save time.
            </p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              For instance, in the example report below, you can see that one ‘opportunity’ recommendation to ‘defer offscreen
              images’
              could save the sample page 3.48 seconds:

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              In addition to this example, each audit has a reference document explaining the findings, as well as guidance on
              what
              you can do to fix the issues it highlights.
            </p>

            <img class="w-full h-full mb-8" src="../img/Opportunities.png" alt="Opportunities">

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              To summarise, Lighthouse helps us by effectively monitoring website quality and makes it clear what needs to be
              fixed.

              How do global brands score in Lighthouse?
            </h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              You might be thinking that it’s surely only the smaller sites that can really benefit from Lighthouse’s audits and
              that
              leading, major brands with big and powerful sites would all score well - the reality is quite different and there
              are
              many major companies with low scoring sites.
            </p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              Here’s an example of this, ASOS - a UK retail brand with a £2.5 billion annual revenue - *currently scores just
              19/100
              for performance.

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              The above is just one example of many big names who don’t perform well. Looking further afield, there are companies
              from
              within the SEO industry and even providers of specialist SEO/SEM tools who currently score low in Lighthouse.
            </p>

              While this might be surprising news to you, there are a number of factors that are contributing to this being the
              case
              for many sites - one of the main examples being that Lighthouse algorithm changes regularly which can have notable
              knock-on effects on sites that were previously scoring highly.
            </p>

            <h3 class="my-4 text-2xl md:text-4xl font-black">
              Delete’s website as an example
            </h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              18 months ago on the main stage at BrightonSEO I talked about how you can achieve rankings by using ‘Usage Metrics’.
              The
              example I used for this was Delete’s website which we then optimised and got up to a perfect score of 100/100.
            </p>

            <img class="w-full h-full mb-8" src="../img/Mobile si Desktop Speed slide.png" alt="Mobile &amp; Desktop Speed slide">

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              However, skip forward to the present and Delete’s website was shown to score only 56/100 in Lighthouse.
            </p>

            <img class="w-full h-full mb-8" src="../img/Delete page speed score.png" alt="Delete page speed score">

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              This drop was also despite the regular hard work of the Delete Dev Team who follow a long list of best practices to
              ensure our site is kept up to scratch. A screenshot from our knowledge base below shows exactly how much we already
              do:

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              But, based on this change in score for the Delete site, it was clear that even this list of best practices isn’t
              enough
              to score top marks.
            </p>

              Improving the score
            </h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              Not to be outdone by this, our frontend and backend developers gathered together and analysed the Lighthouse
              reports,
              and from this they devised a list of changes they could make to build a new version of the site and improve Delete’s
              score one again to get it back to 100%.
            </p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              Their top level notes consisted of the following that they would look to action and improve :

              I will now take you through each of these, expanding on what approaches they decided to take based on the findings

              Migrating from HTTP/1 to HTTP/2
            </h3>

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              They first decided to migrate from HTTP/1 to HTTP/2. If you’re new to this, HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer
              Protocol and is used for communication between client computers and web servers by the sending and receiving of HTTP
              requests and HTTP responses.
            </p>

            <img class="w-full h-full mb-8"  src="../img/Migrating from HTTP1 to HTTP2.png" alt="Migrating from HTTP/1 to HTTP/2">

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              HTTP/2 was originally developed by Google and was designed to decrease latency to improve page load speed in web
              browsers.
            </p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              However, one of the main limitations of HTTP/2 is that for every request, a browser establishes a connection (plus
              encryption and handshakes if HTTPS / secure), no matter how small each resource is (image, script, css, video,
              etc.).The process often takes longer than the transfer of data itself.
            </p>

              size images to use.

              Using a critical approach to JS and CSS

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              We know that a browser doesn’t start rendering a page until it loads and parses all the resources. More precisely, it loads the HTML, parses it, finds the external resources (JS, CSS), queues them, downloads them, parses and evaluates them and only then renders the page.
            </p>
              
            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              What we realised is that this presents a problem for websites with large single JS and CSS files - basically, the process of parsing and evaluation takes a long time. It also means that the user has to wait until this process finishes before meaningful content starts loading. These issues were something we needed to rectify with our site.
            </p>
              
            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              For example, none of these frames contain meaningful content:

              We checked if the browser requested a page for the first time. If this was the case, we would then take only the necessary resources (JS, CSS) for a page, and inline them into the HTML markup, in the HEAD&nbsp; tag. Then when the browser receives the HTML it gets all the necessary resources and parses them in a single process. This enables the browser to show page content to users almost instantly.

              We also created anonymous cookies as markers for the resource that was already loaded. So when a page loaded, we checked if the browser already had our resources cookies in order to determine if we needed to send inline resources, or to take them from the cache.

              Instead of having one large CSS or JS file we decided to break up all CSS and JS into smaller chunks - or smaller

              What I’m pleased to say is these approaches helped us reach our goal and the Delete site once again has a 100%
              Lighthouse score.

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              A key thing to note with all this though is that we focused purely on specific technical aspects, which we developed
              in order to make the new Delete website better, faster, more adaptive.

              These numbers show that we managed to get our page to fully load in just 2 seconds which is a third of the original
              time. But more importantly, those using our site can access content in less than one second, which is almost instant
              even on a slow 3G connection.

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              On top of creating a useful Lighthouse optimisation strategy, with this experiment I solidified my belief in
              something I’ve been feeling confident about for a while, which is that it’s time for SEOs and Developers to unite!
            </p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              I can honestly say that without the support and help of our Dev Team I wouldn’t have been able to achieve a 100%
              score on the new Delete site. Their help and support was invaluable and fed in smoothly with my SEO consultation
              work.

              Lighthouse optimisation is not a one-off task

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              We’ve also realised that on-going Lighthouse optimisation is the new norm.It is time to stop thinking that once a
              website is optimised it will remain optimised for good - this is something we learned the hard way. Simply put, you
              need to regularly check and review performance.

            <p class="leading-relaxed  tracking-normal text-base md:text-lg text-black my-4 pb-4">
              After replacing the old website with the new optimised version we saw a significant improvement in rankings for most
              of our core keywords. In some cases, our rankings have moved up by more than two SERPs.
